## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to Christopher Edwards (christopher.edwards@krminc.com) for his work on Node Inspector
integration which has been adapted and included in EWD.js (build 67 and later).

Thanks also to Ward De Backer for suggestions relating to user authentication

## Installing EWD.js

Create a directory for your EWD.js environment, eg *~/ewdjs*

Then, assuming you've already installed Node.js:

       cd ~/ewdjs
       npm install ewdjs

Modify that first *cd* command as appropriate for your system.

In the *node_modules/ewdjs* directory that has now been created, you'll find a file named *install.js*.  It is 
recommended that you run this in order to create the run-time environment and to move the files in
the repository to their correct run-time destinations.  So run the following:

       cd node_modules/ewdjs
       node install


## Running EWD.js
	
After you run the install file, you'll find a number of pre-built example startup files for the various
databases and operating systems on which the databases are supported.  For example, to start up EWD.js 
for use with the GT.M database (which runs on Linux):

      cd ~/ewdjs
      node ewdStart-gtm

Again, modify that first *cd* command as appropriate for your system.

You may need to edit the startup file to specify a different webServer port, external listener port,
child processes pool size, custom directories etc.

## Create a GT.M-based system from scratch

Instead of going through the steps above, EWD.js provides some install scripts that do all the work for you.
One of these sets of scripts will create a complete working system that includes the GT.M database, 
Node.js and EWD.js.  All you need is a new, empty Ubuntu 14.04 (or later) machine, virtual machine or
EC2 instance.

Start up the Ubuntu 14.04 machine.  Login and type:

      sudo apt-get install -y subversion
      svn export https://github.com/robtweed/ewd.js/trunk/gtm gtm
      source gtm/install.sh

That's it!  You can test that everything has worked by typing:

      node test-gtm

If no errors appear, you should be good to go.  Start EWD.js by typing:

      node ewdStart-gtm gtm-config

Start the new, improved EWDMonitor application using the usual URL:

      http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080/ewd/ewdMonitor/index.html

## Create a GlobalsDB-based system from scratch

It's equally as quick and easy to create an EWD.js system that uses GlobalsDB instead of GT.M. 
Once again, all you need is a new, empty Ubuntu machine, virtual machine or
EC2 instance.  For the GlobalsDB-based install scripts, you aren't restricted to Ubuntu 14.04 - any
version will do.

Start up the Ubuntu machine.  Login and type:

      sudo apt-get install -y subversion
      svn export https://github.com/robtweed/ewd.js/trunk/globalsdb globalsdb
      source globalsdb/install.sh

That's it!  Start EWD.js by typing:

      node ewdStart-globals

Start the EWDMonitor application using the usual URL:

      http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080/ewd/ewdMonitor/index.html

## Upgrade a dEWDrop Virtual Machine

You can automatically upgrade Node.js and NodeM and install EWD.js on a dEWDrop VM as follows:

      sudo apt-get install subversion
      svn export https://github.com/robtweed/ewd.js/trunk/dEWDrop dewdrop
      source dewdrop/upgrade.sh

When finished, you can start up EWD.js using:

      node ewdStart-gtm dewdrop-config

Start the new, improved EWDMonitor application using the usual URL:

      http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080/ewd/ewdMonitor/index.html


Move any existing applications to */home/vista/ewdjs/www*  and modules to */home/vista/ewdjs/node_modules*
